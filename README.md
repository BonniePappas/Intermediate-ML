## 📌 Overview
This repository hosts course materials, assignments, and notes for **Intermediate Machine Learning (S&DS 365)**.  
The course provides a deeper exploration of modern machine learning methods and the mathematical frameworks that explain when and why these methods work.

Key highlights:
- Nonparametric regression and classification
- Kernel methods and risk bounds
- Nonparametric Bayesian approaches
- Neural networks, CNNs, and transformers
- Generative models and sparsity on manifolds
- Reinforcement learning

Assignments and quizzes give hands-on experience with Python and Jupyter notebooks, helping students build the ability to adapt ML techniques to new problems.
